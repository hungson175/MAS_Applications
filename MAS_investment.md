### Summary of the Multi-Agent System for Backtesting Long-Term Investment Strategies

Our multi-agent system is designed to backtest long-term investment strategies by identifying and analyzing top-performing industries and companies based on defined financial metrics. The system comprises the following agents:

#### 1. Industry Analyzer Agent (IAA)
- **Role**: Analyze historical data from 2017 to 2021 to identify the top five performing industries based on robust industry performance metrics.
- **Metrics Used**: Market Share Growth, Industry Revenue Growth, Industry Profit Margins, Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), and Industry Employment Growth.

#### 2. Metrics Evaluation Agent (MEA)
- **Role**: Define "good" values for six key financial metrics for companies within each of the top-performing industries identified by the IAA.
- **Metrics Used**: Revenue Growth, Profit Margins (Gross/Operating/Net), Return on Equity (ROE), Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E), and Free Cash Flow (FCF).

#### 3. Company Selection Agent (CSA)
- **Role**: Filter and select the top ten companies in each of the best industries based on the metrics defined by the MEA.
- **Task**: Ensure that the selected companies meet the "good" values for the six key financial metrics.

#### 4. Top Picks Analysis Agent (TPAA)
- **Role**: Further analyze the top ten companies in each of the best industries to select the top three companies, ensuring the best candidates for long-term investment.
- **Task**: Conduct a deeper financial analysis and assess growth potential to finalize the best picks.

#### 5. Strategic Investment System Manager (SISM)
- **Role**: Oversee the entire multi-agent system, ensuring each agent operates efficiently and collaboratively. Validate outputs, provide strategic insights, and ensure alignment with broader investment goals.
- **Task**: Coordinate the workflow among agents, validate their outputs, and monitor the performance of the selected companies over the years 2022 and 2023.

### Workflow
1. **IAA** analyzes historical industry data and identifies the top five industries.

3. **CSA** filters and selects the top ten companies in each industry based on these metrics.
4. **TPAA** conducts a deeper analysis to select the top three companies in each industry.
5. **SISM** oversees the process, validates results, and ensures the system meets strategic investment goals.

Sony offers a variety of display technologies in the mid-price range, primarily focusing on LED and OLED panels. The LED models, such as the [Sony X77L](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-sony-tv/), provide a cost-effective solution with a 4K resolution and HDR10 support.

His covers accumulated over 30 million views, demonstrating the power of digital platforms in building a global audience.

One of the primary challenges for Vietnamese artists aiming for global success is overcoming language and cultural barriers. While artists like [Fujii Kaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujii_Kaze) have successfully transcended these barriers by incorporating universal themes and emotions in their music, Vietnamese artists must find ways to make their content relatable to a global audience.

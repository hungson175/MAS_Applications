# Nền kinh tế Việt Nam và nguy cơ bẫy thu nhập trung bình

Vietnam's economic journey over the past three decades has been marked by remarkable progress, transitioning from a low-income to a middle-income country. This transformation has been driven by robust economic growth, averaging around 7% annually, and significant integration into global trade networks. However, as Vietnam approaches the threshold of an upper-middle-income status, it faces the critical challenge of avoiding the middle-income trap—a situation where a country's growth stagnates after reaching middle-income levels.

The middle-income trap is a prevalent concern for developing economies, characterized by a slowdown in growth due to rising costs and declining competitiveness. Despite Vietnam's impressive economic strides, its GDP per capita, which stood at $3,590 in 2021, remains significantly lower than the global average. This disparity highlights the urgency for Vietnam to implement comprehensive reforms to sustain its growth trajectory and achieve its ambitious goal of becoming a high-income country by 2045.

Several factors contribute to Vietnam's vulnerability to the middle-income trap. The economy's heavy reliance on foreign direct investment (FDI) and low-cost labor has limited its technological autonomy and innovation capacity. Moreover, internal economic weaknesses, such as inefficient institutions and inadequate infrastructure, pose significant hurdles. As noted by experts like [Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/how-will-vietnam-escape-the-middle-income-trap-2084398.html), institutional reforms are crucial for Vietnam to transition to a high-income economy, as exemplified by countries like South Korea and Singapore.

Vietnam's government recognizes these challenges and has outlined strategic priorities to address them. Key initiatives include enhancing institutional quality, fostering innovation, and improving human capital through education and training. Additionally, Vietnam aims to capitalize on its socio-political stability and large domestic market to drive sustainable growth.

In conclusion, Vietnam stands at a crossroads, with the potential to either fall into the middle-income trap or continue its upward trajectory towards high-income status. The path forward requires decisive policy implementation, focusing on institutional reforms, technological advancements, and sustainable development strategies. As Vietnam navigates this critical phase, the lessons learned from other nations' experiences will be invaluable in shaping its economic future.

## Vietnam's Economic Growth Potential and Current Status

### Economic Growth Trajectory

Vietnam's economic growth has been robust, with the country achieving significant milestones over the past few decades. As of 2023, Vietnam's GDP reached nearly $430 billion, with a per capita income of approximately $4,347 ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/vietnam-s-economic-surge-nearing-high-middle-income-classification-2300448.html)). This represents a substantial increase from the early 1990s when the per capita income was around $200. The country's growth rate often ranges between 6-8%, positioning it among the fastest-growing economies in the region ([Source of Asia](https://www.sourceofasia.com/vietnams-economic-odyssey-a-flashback-to-2023-and-glimpses-into-2024/)).

### Sectoral Contributions to Growth

Vietnam's economy is diversified across several sectors, with manufacturing playing a pivotal role. The country has become a major exporter within ASEAN, with manufactured goods comprising 95% of total exports by 2020 ([ERIA](https://www.eria.org/uploads/media/Books/2023-VietNam-2045/10_ch.6-How-to-Escape-Middle-Income-Trap.pdf)). The digital economy also surged by 19% in 2023, reaching $30 billion, indicating a strong shift towards technology-driven growth ([KPMG](https://kpmg.com/vn/en/home/insights/2024/03/vietnam-2024-outlook-the-investor-guide-to-growth.html)).

### Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

FDI has been a cornerstone of Vietnam's economic strategy, with the country attracting $36.6 billion in 2023, marking a 32.1% increase from the previous year ([KPMG](https://kpmg.com/vn/en/home/insights/2024/03/vietnam-2024-outlook-the-investor-guide-to-growth.html)). This influx of investment is largely attributed to Vietnam's strategic location, competitive workforce, and favorable investment policies. The manufacturing, energy, and real estate sectors have been the primary beneficiaries of FDI, driving industrialization and economic expansion.

### Challenges and Structural Issues

Despite its achievements, Vietnam faces several challenges that could hinder its growth trajectory. The threat of the middle-income trap looms large, with the country needing to transition from input-driven growth to total factor productivity-led growth ([Saigon Times](https://english.thesaigontimes.vn/middle-income-trap-looms-large/)). The non-state sector, which accounts for a significant portion of employment, suffers from low productivity, highlighting the need for structural reforms ([ERIA](https://www.eria.org/uploads/media/Books/2023-VietNam-2045/10_ch.6-How-to-Escape-Middle-Income-Trap.pdf)).

### Innovation and Research & Development (R&D)

To sustain growth and avoid the middle-income trap, Vietnam must enhance its innovation capabilities. The country's R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP is relatively low compared to other Asian countries at similar development stages ([ERIA](https://www.eria.org/uploads/media/Books/2023-VietNam-2045/10_ch.6-How-to-Escape-Middle-Income-Trap.pdf)). Improving this metric is crucial for fostering an innovation-led economy. Vietnam's ranking in the Global Innovation Index has improved, but there remains significant room for advancement in various components of innovation.

### Trade and Economic Integration

Vietnam's integration into the global economy has been a key driver of its economic success. The trade dependence ratio, which measures the sum of exports and imports to GDP, rose to 180% in 2021 ([ERIA](https://www.eria.org/uploads/media/Books/2023-VietNam-2045/10_ch.6-How-to-Escape-Middle-Income-Trap.pdf)). The country achieved a record trade surplus of $26 billion in 2023, continuing an eight-year streak of trade surpluses ([Source of Asia](https://www.sourceofasia.com/vietnams-economic-odyssey-a-flashback-to-2023-and-glimpses-into-2024/)). This success is attributed to effective trade promotion strategies and participation in free trade agreements.

### Future Outlook and Policy Recommendations

Looking ahead, Vietnam aims to become an upper-middle-income country by 2030 and a developed nation by 2045. To achieve these goals, the country must focus on strengthening public capacity, improving the legal framework, and enhancing human resource development ([ERIA](https://www.eria.org/uploads/media/Books/2023-VietNam-2045/4_Executive-Summary.pdf)). Additionally, scaling up R&D expenditure and fostering a supportive environment for innovation are critical steps towards sustainable economic growth.

Vietnam's economic potential remains significant, but the country must navigate complex challenges to maintain its growth momentum and avoid the pitfalls of the middle-income trap. Through strategic reforms and continued integration into the global economy, Vietnam can aspire to achieve its long-term development objectives.


## Institutional Challenges and Reforms

Vietnam's journey towards escaping the middle-income trap is significantly hindered by institutional challenges. The country's institutional framework has not evolved at the same pace as its economic growth since the Doi Moi reforms of the late 1980s ([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/05/18/effective-policy-implementation-is-crucial-for-vietnam-to-reach-high-income-status-by-2045-world-bank-group-report-says)). This stagnation affects the country's ability to respond to new and complex global and domestic challenges effectively. Institutional reforms are crucial to enhance efficiency and adaptability, which are necessary for sustainable economic growth.

The institutional quality in Vietnam lags behind other Asian countries, such as South Korea and Singapore, which have successfully transitioned to high-income economies through robust institutional reforms ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/how-will-vietnam-escape-the-middle-income-trap-2084398.html)). The need for bold reforms is evident, with a focus on improving the adaptability of institutions rather than maintaining stability. This approach would enable Vietnam to respond effectively to emerging challenges and opportunities.

## Technological Advancements and Innovation

Technological development and innovation are critical components for Vietnam to overcome the middle-income trap. However, the country has lagged in readiness for technology and innovation compared to regional peers like China and Malaysia. Investment in science and technology remains modest, with spending accounting for only 0.44% of GDP, significantly below the global average of 2.23% ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/how-will-vietnam-escape-the-middle-income-trap-2084398.html)).

To foster innovation, Vietnam must increase its investment in research and development (R&D) and create a conducive environment for startups. The government needs to streamline policies that support technological advancements and simplify administrative procedures for businesses ([VnExpress](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/economy/vietnam-faces-challenges-in-escaping-middle-income-trap-experts-4004879.html)). Practical training for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in adopting information technology and increasing e-commerce trade is also essential for enhancing competitiveness.

## Education and Human Capital Development

Education plays a pivotal role in Vietnam's efforts to escape the middle-income trap. The quality of human resources is crucial for achieving high-income status, but Vietnam's investment in education is relatively low. In 2019, spending on higher education was only 0.6% of GDP, compared to 0.9% in South Korea and 0.82% in Malaysia ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/how-will-vietnam-escape-the-middle-income-trap-2084398.html)).

Improving the admission rate to higher education is necessary to develop a high-quality workforce. The World Bank's report highlighted that the school admission rate after K-12 general education was 28.6% in 2019, much lower than the average of countries with higher average income, which stands at 55.1% ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/how-will-vietnam-escape-the-middle-income-trap-2084398.html)). Enhancing education quality and increasing investment in higher education are vital steps towards building a skilled workforce capable of driving innovation and productivity.

## Economic Diversification and Industrial Upgrading

Vietnam's economic structure needs diversification and upgrading to avoid the middle-income trap. The country has relied heavily on low-value, labor-intensive manufacturing, which is becoming less competitive as wages rise ([Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-can-vietnam-avoid-the-middle-income-trap/)). To sustain growth, Vietnam must transition to higher-value, technology- and capital-intensive industries.

The expansion of foreign direct investment (FDI) has been a significant driver of Vietnam's industrialization, creating job opportunities and boosting exports. However, the focus should shift towards strengthening supporting industries and enhancing the value chain to ensure sustainable growth ([ERIA](https://www.eria.org/uploads/media/Books/2023-VietNam-2045/4_Executive-Summary.pdf)). Promoting sectors such as electronics, automotive, and information technology can help Vietnam move up the value chain and increase its competitiveness in the global market.

## Policy Implementation and Governance

Effective policy implementation and governance are crucial for Vietnam to navigate the middle-income trap. The country has made efforts to build and adjust its legal system to align with free trade agreements, facilitating investment and business activities ([VnEconomy](https://en.vneconomy.vn/escaping-the-middle-income-trap.htm)). However, the pace of these reforms needs to accelerate to address the challenges posed by the middle-income trap.

Vietnam's governance framework must focus on enhancing transparency, accountability, and efficiency in policy implementation. Strengthening public institutions and improving the legal framework are essential for creating a stable and predictable business environment. By addressing these governance challenges, Vietnam can attract more investment, foster innovation, and sustain its economic growth trajectory.

In conclusion, Vietnam faces significant challenges in escaping the middle-income trap, including institutional inefficiencies, technological lag, and the need for economic diversification. Addressing these issues through comprehensive reforms and strategic investments in education, technology, and governance will be crucial for Vietnam to achieve its long-term development goals and transition to a high-income economy.


## Institutional Reforms for Economic Transformation

### Enhancing Institutional Efficiency

Vietnam's economic growth has been impressive, yet its institutional framework has not kept pace with this development. To escape the middle-income trap, Vietnam must focus on enhancing institutional efficiency. This involves streamlining administrative processes and ensuring that institutions can effectively respond to both domestic and global challenges. The World Bank emphasizes the need for Vietnam to create a solid institutional anchor that transforms development priorities into concrete actions ([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/05/18/effective-policy-implementation-is-crucial-for-vietnam-to-reach-high-income-status-by-2045-world-bank-group-report-says)).

### Strengthening Policy Implementation

Effective policy implementation is crucial for Vietnam's transition to a high-income economy. The government must improve its capacity to coordinate and implement economic policy reforms and public investments. This includes enforcing rules and regulations to enhance motivation, trust, and fairness among public and private stakeholders. By adopting a systematic approach to policy implementation, Vietnam can better align its institutional framework with its economic goals ([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/05/18/effective-policy-implementation-is-crucial-for-vietnam-to-reach-high-income-status-by-2045-world-bank-group-report-says)).

## Economic Diversification and Industrial Upgrading

### Promoting Sectoral Diversification

Vietnam's economy needs to diversify beyond its traditional sectors to avoid the middle-income trap. While manufacturing has been a key driver of growth, there is a need to expand into high-value-added industries. This requires fostering innovation and supporting sectors such as technology, finance, and services. By doing so, Vietnam can reduce its reliance on low-cost manufacturing and enhance its economic resilience ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/how-will-vietnam-escape-the-middle-income-trap-2084398.html)).

### Encouraging Industrial Upgrading

Industrial upgrading is essential for Vietnam to enhance its competitiveness and move up the value chain. This involves adopting advanced technologies and improving production processes across various industries. The government should incentivize businesses to invest in research and development (R&D) and support the adoption of cutting-edge technologies. By upgrading its industrial base, Vietnam can increase productivity and create higher-paying jobs ([VnEconomy](https://en.vneconomy.vn/escaping-the-middle-income-trap.htm)).

## Human Capital Development and Education

### Investing in Education and Skills

To escape the middle-income trap, Vietnam must invest in education and skills development. The quality of human resources is critical for achieving sustainable economic growth. Vietnam's spending on education remains low compared to other countries, which hinders its ability to develop a skilled workforce. Increasing investment in education, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, is vital for fostering innovation and enhancing productivity ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/how-will-vietnam-escape-the-middle-income-trap-2084398.html)).

### Enhancing Vocational Training

Vocational training plays a crucial role in equipping the workforce with the skills needed for modern industries. Vietnam should expand its vocational training programs to meet the demands of a rapidly changing economy. This includes collaborating with industries to ensure that training programs are aligned with market needs. By enhancing vocational training, Vietnam can improve the employability of its workforce and support economic diversification ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/how-will-vietnam-escape-the-middle-income-trap-2084398.html)).

## Technological Innovation and Digital Transformation

### Fostering a Culture of Innovation

Innovation is a key driver of economic growth and competitiveness. Vietnam must create an environment that encourages innovation and supports startups. This involves providing incentives for R&D activities and reducing bureaucratic barriers for new businesses. By fostering a culture of innovation, Vietnam can enhance its technological capabilities and drive economic transformation ([VnExpress](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/economy/vietnam-faces-challenges-in-escaping-middle-income-trap-experts-4004879.html)).

### Embracing Digital Transformation

Digital transformation is essential for Vietnam to remain competitive in the global economy. The government should prioritize the development of digital infrastructure and promote the adoption of digital technologies across all sectors. This includes supporting e-commerce, digital finance, and smart manufacturing. By embracing digital transformation, Vietnam can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and create new economic opportunities ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/how-will-vietnam-escape-the-middle-income-trap-2084398.html)).

## Enhancing Governance and Transparency

### Improving Governance Structures

Effective governance is crucial for Vietnam to achieve its economic goals. The government must enhance transparency, accountability, and efficiency in its operations. This involves reforming public institutions and improving the legal framework to create a stable and predictable business environment. By strengthening governance structures, Vietnam can attract more investment and foster sustainable economic growth ([VnEconomy](https://en.vneconomy.vn/escaping-the-middle-income-trap.htm)).

### Ensuring Regulatory Coherence

Regulatory coherence is vital for reducing administrative burdens and facilitating business activities. Vietnam should streamline its regulatory processes and eliminate overlaps in its legal system. This includes protecting minority investors and developing a legal framework for new types of assets, such as digital currencies. By ensuring regulatory coherence, Vietnam can enhance its competitiveness and support economic diversification ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/how-will-vietnam-escape-the-middle-income-trap-2084398.html)).

## Conclusion

Vietnam's economic growth trajectory has been impressive, with significant milestones achieved over the past few decades, including a GDP nearing $430 billion and a per capita income of approximately $4,347 as of 2023 ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/vietnam-s-economic-surge-nearing-high-middle-income-classification-2300448.html)). The country has successfully leveraged foreign direct investment (FDI) and diversified its economy, particularly in manufacturing and the digital sector, which has seen a remarkable 19% growth in 2023 ([KPMG](https://kpmg.com/vn/en/home/insights/2024/03/vietnam-2024-outlook-the-investor-guide-to-growth.html)). However, despite these achievements, Vietnam faces the looming threat of the middle-income trap, necessitating a transition from input-driven growth to productivity-led growth, alongside substantial improvements in institutional efficiency, technological innovation, and human capital development.

To mitigate the risks associated with the middle-income trap, Vietnam must prioritize comprehensive reforms that enhance institutional frameworks, promote education and vocational training, and foster a culture of innovation and digital transformation. Increasing investment in research and development (R&D) and aligning educational outcomes with market needs are critical steps to build a skilled workforce capable of driving higher-value industries ([VietnamNet](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/how-will-vietnam-escape-the-middle-income-trap-2084398.html)). As Vietnam aspires to become an upper-middle-income country by 2030 and a developed nation by 2045, addressing these challenges through strategic policy implementation and governance improvements will be vital for sustaining its economic growth and achieving long-term development objectives.

# Overview of the Communist Party of the Philippines/New People's Army (CPP/NPA)

The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), have been central figures in the ongoing communist insurgency in the Philippines, which is one of the longest-running conflicts in the country. Founded on March 29, 1969, by Jose Maria Sison and former members of the Hukbalahap, the NPA has engaged in a guerrilla war based on the Maoist strategy of a protracted people's war ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_People's_Army)). The CPP-NPA aims to consolidate political power from what it perceives as the current "bourgeois reactionary puppet government" and to aid in the "people's democratic revolution" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_People's_Army)).

## Historical Context and Operations

The NPA primarily operates in the Philippine countryside, where it has established itself in 73 out of the country's 81 provinces across over 110 guerrilla fronts ([Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/New_People's_Army)). In these guerrilla zones, the CPP-NPA has set up a People's Democratic Government, which operates independently of the Philippine government. In such areas, income taxes that would typically go to the government treasury are redirected to the NPA to fund community services ([Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/New_People's_Army)).

The NPA has a long history of targeting mining corporations and logging companies, accusing them of environmental destruction. For instance, in 2011, the NPA attacked three mines in Mindanao, causing $190 million in damages as a response to the murder of an anti-mining activist ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_People's_Army)). The NPA's operations have expanded significantly since the declaration of martial law by Ferdinand Marcos in the 1970s, reaching a mass base of over one million people with a substantial arsenal ([Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/New_People's_Army)).

## Funding Sources

The CPP-NPA has sustained its operations through various funding sources, including revolutionary taxes, foreign donations, and support from non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Government security agencies estimate that from 1987 to 2007, the CPP-NPA earned a total of PHP 7.22 billion (approximately USD 144 million) from these sources ([Small Wars Journal](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/explaining-the-sustainability-of-the-communist-party-of-the-philippines-new-people’s-army)). The revolutionary taxes are collected from businesses and politicians, with those refusing to pay often facing attacks ([Stanford](https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/print_view/149)).

Foreign funding has also played a significant role. The CPP-NPA has received financial support from religious organizations such as the Australian Council of Churches and the United Methodist Church of the United States, as well as from other communist movements in East Germany, Hungary, and Yugoslavia during the late 1980s ([Small Wars Journal](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/explaining-the-sustainability-of-the-communist-party-of-the-philippines-new-people’s-army)). Additionally, the CPP-NPA's international solidarity work (ISW) activities generate funds from global liberation movements and leftist groups ([Small Wars Journal](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/explaining-the-sustainability-of-the-communist-party-of-the-philippines-new-people’s-army)).

## Perception and Designation

The CPP-NPA is perceived differently by various stakeholders. The Philippine government, along with the United States, the European Union, and Japan, has designated the CPP-NPA as a terrorist organization ([Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/New_People's_Army)). This designation reflects concerns over the group's violent activities and its impact on national security. In December 2017, the Duterte administration officially labeled the CPP-NPA as a terrorist organization, a move supported by several international entities ([Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/New_People's_Army)).

Despite these designations, the CPP-NPA continues to engage in peace talks with the Philippine government, represented by the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP). However, these negotiations have often reached an impasse, particularly during the Duterte administration, which unilaterally terminated peace talks in 2019 ([Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/New_People's_Army)).

## Ideological Perspective

The CPP-NPA follows a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist ideology, viewing the Philippines as a semi-colonial, semi-feudal state where political and economic power is concentrated among a local class of landlords and comprador bourgeoisie, aided by foreign imperialists, primarily the United States ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_People's_Army)). The CPP advocates for a two-stage revolution: a People's Democratic Revolution followed by socialist reconstruction to achieve socialism and wrest control from the bourgeoisie ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_People's_Army)).

## Challenges and Sustainability

The CPP-NPA's sustainability is attributed to its strategic design as a protracted people's war and the persistence of conditions that foster impoverished rural communities receptive to its revolutionary message ([ACLED](https://acleddata.com/2023/07/13/the-communist-insurgency-in-the-philippines-a-protracted-peoples-war-continues/)). The group's ability to collect substantial funds from various sources with relative impunity is partly due to the Philippine government's insufficient compliance with international counterterrorism finance standards ([Small Wars Journal](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/explaining-the-sustainability-of-the-communist-party-of-the-philippines-new-people’s-army)).

The CPP-NPA's activities are most pronounced in agrarian regions such as Negros Occidental and Bukidnon, where agrarian unrest is prevalent ([ACLED](https://acleddata.com/2023/07/13/the-communist-insurgency-in-the-philippines-a-protracted-peoples-war-continues/)). These areas serve as ideal staging grounds for the CPP's revolution, given their significant agricultural production and employment ([ACLED](https://acleddata.com/2023/07/13/the-communist-insurgency-in-the-philippines-a-protracted-peoples-war-continues/)).

## Conclusion

The CPP-NPA remains a significant force in the Philippines, driven by a combination of ideological commitment, strategic operations, and diverse funding sources. Despite being designated as a terrorist organization by multiple governments, the CPP-NPA continues to wield influence in rural areas, leveraging socio-economic grievances to sustain its insurgency. The group's future will likely depend on the Philippine government's ability to address underlying socio-economic issues and effectively implement counterterrorism finance measures.

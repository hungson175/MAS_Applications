# The Communist Party of the Philippines/New People's Army (CPP/NPA): An Analytical Overview

## Introduction

The Communist Party of the Philippines/New People's Army (CPP/NPA) represents one of the longest-running communist insurgencies in the world. Established in the late 1960s, the CPP/NPA has been a significant player in the political and social landscape of the Philippines. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the CPP/NPA, examining its history, ideology, and objectives. It also explores various perspectives on the group from citizens, the government, and the international community, with a particular focus on the role of the Chinese government.

## Historical Background

The CPP was founded on December 26, 1968, by Jose Maria Sison, a former student activist who led a Maoist-oriented youth faction within the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP) ([Mapping Militants Project](https://mappingmilitants.org/files/group-profiles/communist_party_of_the_philippines-new_peoples_army.pdf)). The New People's Army (NPA), the armed wing of the CPP, was established in 1969. The CPP/NPA's primary goal is to overthrow the Philippine government and establish a new state led by the working class, free from U.S. influence ([Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/print_view/149)).

## Ideology and Objectives

The CPP/NPA's ideology is rooted in Maoism, emphasizing a protracted people's war and mobilizing the rural masses ([Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-Peoples-Army)). The group's objectives include redistributing land to the landless poor and initiating a cultural revolution. The CPP/NPA has historically focused on building support among the rural peasantry, although it has operated throughout the Philippines ([Mapping Militants Project](https://mappingmilitants.org/files/group-profiles/communist_party_of_the_philippines-new_peoples_army.pdf)).

## Perspectives on the CPP/NPA

### Citizen Perspective

From the citizen's perspective, the CPP/NPA is a polarizing entity. Some view it as a legitimate resistance movement against systemic inequalities and government corruption. The group has been able to attract recruits from universities and impoverished regions, leveraging its image as a champion of the marginalized ([Global Security](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/npa.htm)). However, others see the CPP/NPA as a source of violence and instability, hindering economic development and peace in affected areas ([Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/opinion-communist-insurgency-essential-ingredient-power-politics/)).

### Government Perspective

The Philippine government has consistently viewed the CPP/NPA as a significant threat to national security. The group has been involved in numerous attacks against government forces, infrastructure, and officials. In response, the government has engaged in military operations and peace talks, although these have often been sporadic and inconclusive ([US Department of State](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/35046.htm)). The government has also sought international support to combat the CPP/NPA, resulting in the group's designation as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union ([Global Security](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/npa.htm)).

### International Perspective

Internationally, the CPP/NPA has been recognized as a terrorist organization by several countries, including the United States and the European Union. This designation has led to financial sanctions and travel restrictions on the group's members ([US Department of State](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/35046.htm)). Despite this, the CPP/NPA has maintained connections with other leftist organizations worldwide, seeking support and resources ([Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/print_view/149)).

## Role of the Chinese Government

Historically, the CPP/NPA received support from China, particularly during the early years of its insurgency. This support included weapons, funds, and training, aligning with China's broader strategy of supporting communist movements worldwide ([Global Security](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/npa.htm)). However, China's support waned following the normalization of diplomatic relations with the Philippines in the 1970s. By 2011, China's Communist Party had severed its ties with the CPP/NPA, focusing instead on strengthening bilateral relations with the Philippine government ([Global Security](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/npa.htm)).

## Current Status and Challenges

The CPP/NPA remains active, although its influence has fluctuated over the years. The group has faced internal splits and challenges, resulting in fragmentation into various factions ([Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-Peoples-Army)). Despite these challenges, the CPP/NPA continues to engage in guerrilla warfare, primarily targeting Philippine security forces and government officials ([Mapping Militants Project](https://mappingmilitants.org/files/group-profiles/communist_party_of_the_philippines-new_peoples_army.pdf)).

The Philippine government has intensified its efforts to combat the CPP/NPA, employing both military and non-military strategies. These efforts include community development programs aimed at addressing the root causes of insurgency, such as poverty and inequality ([US Institute of Peace](https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/02/examining-militarys-soft-power-challenge-southern-philippines)).

## Conclusion

The CPP/NPA represents a complex and multifaceted challenge for the Philippines. While the group continues to advocate for social and political change, its methods and objectives have drawn significant criticism and opposition. The perspectives on the CPP/NPA vary widely, reflecting the broader societal divisions within the Philippines. As the government and international community continue to address the insurgency, the CPP/NPA's future remains uncertain, shaped by both internal dynamics and external pressures.

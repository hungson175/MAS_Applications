# The Communist Party of the Philippines/New People's Army (CPP/NPA): An In-Depth Analysis

The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), collectively known as the CPP/NPA, have been central figures in the Philippines' political landscape since their formation in the late 1960s. Established by Jose Maria Sison, the CPP/NPA aims to overthrow the Philippine government and establish a new state led by the working class, while also seeking to expel U.S. influence from the region. The group is rooted in Marxist-Leninist-Maoist ideology, drawing heavily on the concept of a protracted people's war, inspired by China's Maoist movement [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Philippines).

The CPP/NPA has engaged in a long-standing insurgency, making it one of the world's oldest existing communist insurgencies. The organization has historically focused on building support among the rural peasantry, although it operates throughout the Philippines, including urban areas where it employs guerrilla tactics and assassination squads [source](https://mappingmilitants.org/files/group-profiles/communist_party_of_the_philippines-new_peoples_army.pdf). Despite being significantly weakened by internal disputes and military pressure from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), the CPP/NPA remains a potent force, often cited as the most serious threat to national security [source](https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/opinion-communist-insurgency-essential-ingredient-power-politics/).

From a governmental perspective, the CPP/NPA is designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, including the United States and the European Union, due to its history of violence and opposition to U.S. military presence in the Philippines [source](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/35046.htm). The Philippine government has engaged in peace talks with the group, often through the National Democratic Front (NDF), but these efforts have been sporadic and largely unsuccessful, with the Duterte administration unilaterally ending negotiations in 2019 [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Philippines).

Internationally, the CPP/NPA's relationship with China has been complex. Initially supported by the Chinese government, the CPP/NPA received its first shipment of weapons from China in the early 1970s. However, official ties have reportedly been severed since the 1980s, although underground support systems have occasionally surfaced [source](https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/print_view/149). In recent years, the CPP/NPA has shifted its focus away from U.S. imperialism to address concerns about Chinese encroachment, reflecting changing geopolitical dynamics [source](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/explained/article/2179402/mao-more-ever-filipino-communists-half-century-struggle-against).

This report will delve deeper into the CPP/NPA's historical context, ideological foundations, and the multifaceted perspectives surrounding its activities, providing a comprehensive analysis of its enduring impact on Philippine society and international relations.

## Historical Background and Formation

The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), were established in the late 1960s, marking the beginning of one of the world's longest-running communist insurgencies. The CPP was founded on December 26, 1968, by Jose Maria Sison, a former student activist, with the aim of reforming the communist presence in the Philippines and overthrowing the government ([Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/print_view/149)). The NPA was formed in March 1969 as the military arm of the CPP, led by Bernabe Buscayno, also known as Kumander Dante ([GMA Network](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/specialreports/634324/timeline-the-peace-talks-between-the-government-and-the-cpp-npa-ndf-1986-present/story/)).

The CPP-NPA's ideology is rooted in Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, and its primary objective is to establish a socialist state led by the working class. The movement seeks to expel U.S. influence from the Philippines, which they view as a neocolonial power. This ideological stance has led to a long-standing conflict with the Philippine government and has shaped the group's strategies and operations over the decades ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_People%27s_Army_rebellion)).

## Organizational Structure and Strategy

The CPP-NPA operates under a dual organizational structure, with the CPP providing political guidance and the NPA serving as its military arm. The National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) acts as an umbrella organization, representing the CPP-NPA in political and peace negotiations. This structure allows the CPP-NPA to maintain a cohesive strategy while adapting to changing political and military conditions ([Mapping Militants](https://mappingmilitants.org/files/group-profiles/communist_party_of_the_philippines-new_peoples_army.pdf)).

The NPA primarily operates in rural areas, leveraging guerrilla warfare tactics to engage the Philippine military and police forces. However, it also maintains an urban infrastructure to conduct terrorism and assassination operations. The group's targets include security forces, politicians, judges, government informers, and rival splinter groups ([U.S. Department of State](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/35046.htm)).

## Major Incidents and Attacks

Throughout its history, the CPP-NPA has been involved in numerous high-profile attacks and incidents. One of the earliest and most significant attacks occurred on August 21, 1971, when CPP-NPA members threw grenades at a Liberal Party rally in Manila's Plaza Miranda, resulting in nine deaths and 95 injuries. This attack was initially blamed on then-President Ferdinand Marcos, but it was later attributed to the CPP-NPA ([Mapping Militants](https://mappingmilitants.org/files/group-profiles/communist_party_of_the_philippines-new_peoples_army.pdf)).

In more recent years, the CPP-NPA has continued to engage in violent activities, including attacks on infrastructure and military personnel. For example, on August 15, 2015, a CPP-NPA unit launched two attacks in Agusan del Sur, destroying a truck with an improvised explosive device and attacking two individuals, resulting in one death and one injury ([Mapping Militants](https://mappingmilitants.org/files/group-profiles/communist_party_of_the_philippines-new_peoples_army.pdf)).

## Peace Talks and Government Response

Efforts to negotiate peace between the CPP-NPA and the Philippine government have been ongoing since the late 1980s, with varying degrees of success. The first formal peace talks began under President Corazon Aquino in 1986, following the release of political prisoners, including CPP founder Jose Maria Sison. Despite over 40 rounds of negotiations, a lasting peace agreement has remained elusive ([GMA Network](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/specialreports/634324/timeline-the-peace-talks-between-the-government-and-the-cpp-npa-ndf-1986-present/story/)).

In recent years, the Philippine government has adopted a more aggressive stance against the CPP-NPA. In December 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Executive Order No. 70, institutionalizing a "whole-of-nation approach" to end the insurgency. This approach includes the formation of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC), which has been criticized for its red-tagging campaigns and alleged human rights abuses ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_People%27s_Army_rebellion)).

## International Perspectives and China's Role

The CPP-NPA's activities have drawn international attention, particularly from the United States, which has designated the group as a terrorist organization. The CPP-NPA's opposition to U.S. military presence in the Philippines has led to attacks on U.S. military interests and personnel in the past ([U.S. Department of State](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/35046.htm)).

China's relationship with the CPP-NPA is complex and multifaceted. While China has historically supported communist movements worldwide, its current engagement with the Philippines is more focused on economic and diplomatic relations. China has deepened its ties with various Philippine political parties through party-to-party diplomacy, which allows it to influence political discourse and policymaking in the Philippines ([ThinkChina](https://www.thinkchina.sg/politics/chinas-cpc-deepens-ties-philippine-political-parties)).

China's involvement in the Philippines is primarily driven by its strategic interests in the region, including the Belt and Road Initiative and maintaining regional stability. While China does not overtly support the CPP-NPA, its engagement with the broader political landscape in the Philippines allows it to navigate the complex dynamics of the insurgency and its impact on Philippine governance ([ThinkChina](https://www.thinkchina.sg/politics/chinas-cpc-deepens-ties-philippine-political-parties)).


## Perspectives on the CPP/NPA: Citizen, Government, and International Views

### Citizen Perspectives

The Communist Party of the Philippines/New People's Army (CPP/NPA) has been a polarizing entity within the Philippines, eliciting a range of opinions among its citizens. The movement, which began as a response to perceived social injustices, has garnered both support and opposition from the Filipino populace.

#### Support and Sympathy

In rural areas, particularly among the peasantry, there is a degree of sympathy for the CPP/NPA. The group's focus on land redistribution and its opposition to feudalistic structures resonate with the landless poor. Many rural Filipinos view the CPP/NPA as a champion of their rights against an often oppressive and neglectful government. This support is not merely ideological; it is also practical, as the CPP/NPA has historically provided social services in areas where government presence is minimal ([Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/print_view/149)).

#### Opposition and Fear

Conversely, in urban centers and among the middle and upper classes, the CPP/NPA is often viewed with suspicion and fear. The group's tactics, which include guerrilla warfare and extortion through "revolutionary taxes," have led to widespread condemnation. Many citizens see the CPP/NPA as a destabilizing force that exacerbates violence and hinders economic development. The fear of being caught in crossfire or becoming targets of CPP/NPA operations contributes to a negative perception among these demographics ([Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/opinion-communist-insurgency-essential-ingredient-power-politics/)).

### Government Perspectives

The Philippine government has consistently viewed the CPP/NPA as a significant threat to national security. This perspective has shaped its policies and responses over the decades.

#### Security Threat

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) identifies the CPP/NPA as the most serious internal security threat. The government's approach has largely been militaristic, involving extensive military operations aimed at dismantling the group's infrastructure. This approach is reflected in policies such as Executive Order No. 70, which institutionalized a "whole-of-nation approach" to combat the insurgency ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_People%27s_Army_rebellion)).

#### Political Tool

Interestingly, some analysts argue that the CPP/NPA serves as a political tool for the government. By maintaining the insurgency at a manageable level, the government can justify military spending and maintain the relevance of the armed forces. This perspective suggests that the CPP/NPA's existence is paradoxically beneficial to the political status quo, as it prevents the emergence of more viable social movements that could challenge the existing power structures ([Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/opinion-communist-insurgency-essential-ingredient-power-politics/)).

### International Perspectives

International views on the CPP/NPA are shaped by geopolitical interests and the global fight against terrorism.

#### United States

The United States has designated the CPP/NPA as a terrorist organization, aligning with its broader counterterrorism strategy. This designation affects U.S. foreign policy and military aid to the Philippines, as it frames the CPP/NPA as part of the global network of communist insurgencies that threaten democratic governments. The U.S. has historically supported the Philippine government's efforts to combat the CPP/NPA through military aid and training ([U.S. Department of State](https://www.state.gov/)).

#### Norway and Peace Mediation

Norway has played a significant role as a mediator in peace talks between the CPP/NPA and the Philippine government. Norwegian mediators have facilitated negotiations aimed at ending the decades-long conflict, reflecting Norway's commitment to international peacebuilding efforts. Despite numerous attempts, a lasting peace agreement has remained elusive, highlighting the complexities of the conflict and the deep-seated mistrust between the parties ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/philippines-communists-rebels-norway-peace-talks-edc4b997bd301fd6b574e0d950067d2b)).

### Role of the Chinese Government

The relationship between the CPP/NPA and China is complex, characterized by historical ties and contemporary geopolitical dynamics.

#### Historical Support

In the early years of the CPP/NPA, China provided support in the form of weapons and training, aligning with its broader strategy of supporting communist movements worldwide. This support was part of China's ideological commitment to spreading communism during the Cold War era. However, this support waned following the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and the Philippines in the mid-1970s ([Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/print_view/149&lang=en)).

#### Contemporary Engagement

Today, China's engagement with the Philippines is primarily economic and diplomatic rather than ideological. While China does not overtly support the CPP/NPA, its influence in the region is significant. Through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, China seeks to maintain regional stability, which indirectly impacts the dynamics of the CPP/NPA insurgency. China's involvement in the Philippines' political landscape allows it to navigate the complexities of the insurgency while focusing on its strategic interests ([ThinkChina](https://www.thinkchina.sg/)).

### The CPP/NPA's Impact on Philippine Society

The CPP/NPA insurgency has had profound implications for Philippine society, affecting political, economic, and social dynamics.

#### Political Impact

The insurgency has influenced Philippine politics by shaping policy decisions and government priorities. The need to address the insurgency has led to significant military spending and has influenced electoral politics, with candidates often taking strong stances on how to handle the CPP/NPA issue. This focus on security often diverts attention from other critical issues such as poverty alleviation and economic development ([Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/143551-cpp-npa-ndf-peace-talks/)).

#### Economic Consequences

Economically, the CPP/NPA insurgency has deterred investment in affected areas, contributing to underdevelopment and poverty. The group's extortion practices, through "revolutionary taxes," have also placed a financial burden on businesses, further hindering economic growth. The ongoing conflict has made it challenging to implement infrastructure projects and attract foreign investment, particularly in rural areas where the CPP/NPA is active ([Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/print_view/149)).

#### Social Ramifications

Socially, the CPP/NPA has contributed to a culture of fear and mistrust in affected communities. The conflict has resulted in numerous human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and forced displacements. The protracted nature of the insurgency has also fostered a sense of hopelessness among some Filipinos, particularly in rural areas where government services are lacking. This environment has perpetuated cycles of poverty and violence, making it difficult to achieve lasting peace and development ([Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/voices/imho/opinion-communist-insurgency-essential-ingredient-power-politics/)).

In summary, the CPP/NPA remains a significant force in the Philippines, influencing various aspects of society. Its impact is felt not only within the country but also in the international arena, as foreign governments and organizations engage with the complex dynamics of the insurgency. The perspectives on the CPP/NPA are varied and multifaceted, reflecting the intricate nature of the conflict and its deep roots in Philippine history and society.


## Chinese Influence on the CPP/NPA Insurgency

### Historical Context of Chinese Support

While previous sections have discussed the historical support provided by China to the CPP/NPA in terms of weapons and training during the Cold War era, this section will delve deeper into the strategic motivations behind China's involvement. China's initial support for the CPP/NPA was part of its broader strategy to promote communist ideologies globally, particularly in Southeast Asia, which was a region of strategic interest during the Cold War. This support was not merely ideological but also aimed at countering U.S. influence in the region. The Philippines, being a key ally of the United States, presented a significant opportunity for China to extend its influence by supporting insurgent groups like the CPP/NPA ([Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/print_view/149)).

### Shift in Chinese Policy Post-Normalization

The normalization of diplomatic relations between China and the Philippines in the mid-1970s marked a significant shift in Chinese policy towards the CPP/NPA. This section will explore how China's foreign policy priorities evolved, leading to a reduction in overt support for the CPP/NPA. The normalization process was driven by China's desire to improve bilateral relations with its Southeast Asian neighbors and to integrate into the global economic system. As a result, China began to distance itself from supporting insurgent movements, including the CPP/NPA, to foster better diplomatic and economic ties with the Philippines. This strategic realignment was also influenced by China's broader economic reforms and opening-up policies initiated under Deng Xiaoping ([Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-Peoples-Army)).

### Contemporary Chinese Engagement

While the previous section on contemporary engagement highlighted the complex geopolitical dynamics between China and the CPP/NPA, this section will focus on the current state of Chinese involvement, if any, with the insurgency. In recent years, China's engagement with the Philippines has been primarily economic, characterized by investments and infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative. There is no substantial evidence to suggest that China currently provides direct support to the CPP/NPA. Instead, China's focus has shifted towards maintaining stable relations with the Philippine government to safeguard its economic interests in the region. This pragmatic approach underscores China's prioritization of state-to-state relations over ideological affiliations with non-state actors like the CPP/NPA ([CIA](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP87T01127R000100040007-6.pdf)).

### Geopolitical Implications of Chinese Involvement

This section examines the broader geopolitical implications of China's historical and contemporary involvement with the CPP/NPA. China's initial support for the CPP/NPA had significant implications for regional security dynamics, contributing to the complexity of the Cold War landscape in Southeast Asia. The shift in Chinese policy post-normalization reflects China's adaptation to the changing geopolitical environment and its desire to be seen as a responsible global actor. However, the historical ties between China and the CPP/NPA continue to influence perceptions and narratives within the Philippines, affecting both domestic politics and foreign policy. The legacy of Chinese involvement remains a point of contention in Philippine political discourse, often invoked in discussions about foreign influence and national sovereignty ([Small Wars Journal](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/the-leadership-crisis-in-the-communist-party-of-the-philippines-new-people’s-army)).

### The Role of Chinese Soft Power

In contrast to the historical military and ideological support, this section explores China's use of soft power as a tool to influence the Philippines and, by extension, the CPP/NPA insurgency. China's soft power strategy involves cultural diplomacy, educational exchanges, and media influence to project a positive image and build goodwill among the Filipino populace. This approach aims to counterbalance any negative perceptions stemming from past associations with insurgent groups. By fostering people-to-people connections and promoting cultural understanding, China seeks to enhance its influence in the Philippines, thereby indirectly impacting the CPP/NPA's ability to leverage anti-Chinese sentiments as part of its ideological narrative ([SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3027414/explained-philippines-communist-rebellion-asias-longest-running)).

In summary, while China's direct involvement with the CPP/NPA has diminished over the years, its historical support and contemporary geopolitical strategies continue to shape the dynamics of the insurgency. China's evolving role reflects broader shifts in its foreign policy priorities, balancing ideological commitments with pragmatic economic and diplomatic considerations.

## Conclusion

The research report provides a comprehensive overview of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), detailing their historical formation, organizational structure, and the ongoing insurgency that has persisted for over five decades. Key findings highlight the dual nature of the CPP-NPA's operations, which combine guerrilla warfare in rural areas with urban tactics, including terrorism and assassination. The group's ideological commitment to Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and its opposition to U.S. influence in the Philippines have shaped its long-standing conflict with the Philippine government. Despite numerous attempts at peace negotiations since the late 1980s, a lasting resolution remains elusive, particularly as the government adopts more aggressive counterinsurgency measures, such as the "whole-of-nation approach" initiated under President Rodrigo Duterte ([GMA Network](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/specialreports/634324/timeline-the-peace-talks-between-the-government-and-the-cpp-npa-ndf-1986-present/story/)).

The implications of the CPP-NPA's insurgency are profound, affecting not only national security and governance but also economic and social dynamics within the Philippines. The conflict has deterred investment, exacerbated poverty, and contributed to a culture of fear, particularly in rural communities. Additionally, the international dimension of the CPP-NPA's activities, including its historical ties to China and designation as a terrorist organization by the United States, underscores the complexity of the insurgency within the broader geopolitical context ([U.S. Department of State](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/35046.htm)). Moving forward, addressing the root causes of the insurgency, such as social inequality and lack of government services, will be crucial for achieving sustainable peace and development in the Philippines. Enhanced dialogue and cooperation among local communities, the government, and international mediators may provide pathways to a more comprehensive resolution of this enduring conflict.
